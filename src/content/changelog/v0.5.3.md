## New Features

### Conditional Expressions

- Boolean logic with `if()` function
- Three-argument syntax: `if(condition, then_value, else_value)`
- Short-circuit evaluation
- Expression-based conditionals

### Piecewise Functions

- Multi-branch conditionals with `piecewise()`
- Sequential condition evaluation
- Default value support
- Mathematical function support

### Parser Migration

- Migrated to Pest PEG parser generator
- Improved parsing reliability
- Better error messages
- Cleaner grammar specification

### Linear Programming Documentation

- Standard form conventions
- Simplex method documentation
- Optimization problem setup
